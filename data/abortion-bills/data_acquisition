I obtained the roll-call votes of the 115th congress using the Rvoteview package (Sonnet 2015). The package allows me to access the Voteview database (Lewis et al. 2020). As it allows me to search for keywords, I chose the ones linked to “abortion”. This query produced seven results. These datasets contained the following data: the ICPSR number that can be used to identify the member of the congress, and the respective member’s voting decision regarding those seven bills. Data on the members were also obtained from the Voteview database. These were used to obtain the members’ party affiliation. The gender was obtained using a list of women in the 115th Congress from Infoplease (Infoplease 2018) and subsequently manually included in the dataset. …
The networks were then built as follows: First, I looked for all possible combinations of members, classifying the former one as “from” and the latter one as “to”. Second, I merged the data frame with both members’ voting decisions. Thereby, I created two edgelists: one with agreements and one with disagreements. Third, for both data frames I created a new column indicating whether both agreed/disagreed (1), disagreed/agreed
(0), or at least one of them was absent (0). Handling abstention was a bit trickier as is shown by Mendonca et al. (2015) who dealt with voting decisions of members of the European Parliament. They treated abstention as either “half an agreement” (Mendonca et al. 2015: 125) or as the absence of opinion—leading to agreement if both MEPs chose abstention. I chose the former approach.
