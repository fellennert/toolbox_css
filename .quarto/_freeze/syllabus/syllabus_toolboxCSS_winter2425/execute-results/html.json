From web scraping to AI-powered text analysis, you’ll learn to harness the power of computation to gain new insights into social phenomena.\nThe curriculum covers a range of topics including data management, web scraping, text analysis, analyzing spatial data, and agent-based simulation. Students will hone their R and develop skills in Python, applying these languages to real-world social science problems. The course progresses from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, including the use of state-of-the-art AI models for text analysis.\nThe course structure consists of one lecture and one workshop per week, providing a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application. Throughout the semester, students will benefit from hands-on coding exercises, one-on-one mentoring, and collaborative projects. The course culminates in a group research paper, allowing students to apply their new skills to a topic of their choice. This course is ideal for social scientists looking to enhance their computational skills. It is geared towards 2nd year Master’s students who are enrolled in the reformed Sociology Master’s program. Interested Bachelor’s students (semester 5 or higher) are also very welcome to attend, however, they will not be able to earn credits with their attendance.\n\n# What to expect\n\nThis course is structured so that it provides you -- the student -- with theory-heavy lectures (on Tuesdays) and hands-on R sessions (Thursdays). The lectures aim to introduce you to how you can use techniques to conduct empirical research and will mostly consist of the presentation of innovative and/or cutting-edge research that has harnessed digital data to solve exciting research puzzles. The practical sessions will be delivered as videos. You are expected to watch these and work on exercises during the session. This ensures that students can work at their own pace and rewatch the content that might be unclear if needed.\n\nThe main objective of this course is that students **perform their own research as the course unfolds**. To this end, we will talk about your interests and then assign you to groups of matching research interests. Students are then expected to continue working on their projects as the course unfolds. Students can of course also work individually.\n\nTo ensure that nobody is stuck with their research, I require one-on-one meetings with each group (including groups of 1) during each week. These meetings are very casual, not graded, and can be thought of as a mere check-in. They also do not replace but rather complement office hours. \n\nAt the very end of the course, it is time for \"peer reviewed presentations\" of your projects. One of your peers' groups will be assigned your project and provide comments on it. This peer review ensures that you are right on track and that everyone has accomplished the course's learning goals. After that, you are all good to go and can check your analyses and write up your resulting papers so that they resemble a proper empirical research paper (see more in \"Expectations\" below).\n\nThe actual \"peer-review\" will work as follows: first, you present your work briefly (10 minutes). Then, the assigned reviewer group will provide their comments (5 minutes). They are supposed to give feedback on the question/motivation, the chosen theoretical angle, the data, and the method. The reviewers shall summarize each section briefly and point out what they perceive as strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, they can suggest how to frame the questions, provide further literature, or point out alternate methodological approaches that may be better suited to test the hypotheses.\n\nTo facilitate this, you must send presentations presenting the main idea, some theory (including hypotheses), a preliminary testing strategy, and the first results to me by **January 29, 2025**, so I can distribute them to your peers.\n\nThe deadline for the paper (\"Forschungsbericht\") is **March 21, 2025**. Please send it to Simone Müller ([muellers@uni-leipzig.de](muellers@uni-leipzig.de)) -- and feel also free to CC me. Code and data have to be sent to me via email (depending on data size, data can also be shared via Google Drive/Dropbox/Uni Leipzig Wolke). The code should run \"out of the box\" and contain everything necessary to replicate the results and graphs in the paper. Preferably, this is in chronological order and structured into sections with descriptive titles.\n\n## Extensions\n\nExtensions can be granted for particular reasons. These involve, among others, internships and sickness. In the case of the former, please give me a quick heads-up so that I can arrange it (preferably with some sort of proof). If you need an extension for a different reason than the ones mentioned above, feel free to reach out anytime, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs.\n\n## Expectations\n\n* the basics\n  + font size 12 pt, 1.5 line spacing\n  + no typos, grammatical flaws, etc. (you are living in the age of helpers such as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com), there are no more excuses)\n  + length: between 4,000 and 8,000 words\n  +  cite correctly and in a uniform manner; my preferred citation style: ASA (it's strongly advised to use Zotero and Quarto/Overleaf; resources can be provided upon request)\n* structured as an empirical research paper: \n  + the *introduction* contains an empirical social scientific research question that is theoretically and practically motivated (i.e., showing its scientific and real-world relevance)\n  + the *theory section* provides a **brief** overview of relevant prior research; clearly testable hypotheses are derived from the literature/goals for exploratory analyses are formulated\n  + in *data and methods*, the data (including acquisition strategy), as well as the analysis strategy, are described; in our case, the data consist of text, the analyses are related to the course content; data and methods need to enable valid results\n  + *results* need to be visualized through tables and/or (gg)plots and described in the text; tables and visualizations need to be properly labeled so that they can \"stand on their own\"\n  + *discussion* of the results is performed in lieu of the theoretical foundations; potential shortcomings and reach of the paper are outlined\n  + the *conclusion* circles back to the introduction and connects it to the results; it needs to clearly answer the research question\n\n# Basic rules of behavior \n\n* If anything is unclear, ask me. This probably means that I have failed my job, and your question offers me a second chance to fix this.\n* No discrimination. Never. If you witness any, tell me. I will find a way to deal with it.\n* THIS IS IMPORTANT: If there are problems, reach out whenever. Do not let them become too big.\n* Copy code from the internet -- but you are responsible for the solution, so please make sure it works and solves your problem.\n* Generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT et al.) is explicitly allowed. In my opinion, it is a tool that is here to stay, and you should use whatever resource you have to get the job(s) done. Plus, writing the right prompt is a skill in itself that you should definitely hone. If you use it for your writing, please make sure to proof-read everything properly, since you will be held accountable for both content and style.\n* Form groups with your peers for working on the material. Everything will be easier and more fun. Except for when you have free riders. Kick them out of your group. \n* AGAIN: ask questions if needed. Anytime. \n\n\n# Schedule\n\nAs stated above, Tuesdays are lectures and Thursdays are lab sessions. Please bring a laptop to all of our meetings (if you don't have one, feel free to reach out and we will try our best to lend you one).\n\nLiterature-wise, we will use a mix of textbooks and review papers to introduce theoretical concepts and related studies to illustrate. In terms of programming, we will mostly rely on online resources. However, everything that is relevant in terms of R content (and more!) can be found in the R script. \n\nEvery reading will be either provided online or linked to in this syllabus (just click on _\"[online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\"_ -- the link is hidden behind it. \n\nI do not expect you to read the literature and will do the theoretical sessions in a \"lecture\" style. This is because this is an applied course and not every piece of content has the same relevance for everyone. Having been a student myself, I think that students should not be overwhelmed by having to read everything while working on their projects. I will upload additional readings on top of the ones this syllabus mentions in case you want to read more and need some inspo.\n\n## Week 1: Kick Off\n\n### Welcome & Housekeeping (Tue, 15 October 2024; 15:15 – 16:45; NSG, SR 423)\n\nNo readings.\n\n### Setting up your workstation (Thu, 17 October 2024; 11:15 – 12:45; NSG, SR 329)\n\n* Acquire access to _[sc.uni-leipzig.de](www.sc.uni-leipzig.de)_\n* R recap (the corresponding chapters can be found in the R4DS book -- _[online](https://r4ds.hadley.nz)_\n  + `RMarkdown`/`Quarto` -- chapters 28 & 29\n  + `dplyr` -- chapter 4\n  + `tidyr` -- chapter 6\n  + `ggplot2` -- chapters 2 & 10 & 11 & 12\n  + `purrr` & loops in different flavors -- chapter 27\n  + functional programming -- chapter 26\n\n## Week 2: New Possibilities of CSS\n\n### Why CSS?
