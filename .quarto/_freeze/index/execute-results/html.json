It covers different techniques for the aspiring computational social scientist, hence I have dubbed it \"Toolbox CSS.\" You can reach me anytime at [felix.lennert@uni-leipzig.de](mailto:felix.lennert@uni-leipzig.de). If you're interested in my academic work, you can visit [my website](https://felix-lennert.netlify.app). \n\n![In the field, harvesting some fresh raw material before transforming it to insights (&copy; Alexandra Gibbons)](figures/data_pic.jpg){width=300}\n\nHere's the official description:\n\n> The Forschungsseminar in Computational Social Science (CSS) equips you with the tools to analyze human behavior, predict social trends, and tackle complex societal issues using cutting-edge data science techniques. From web scraping to AI-powered text analysis, you'll learn to use your computer in new ways to gain insights into social phenomena.\n\nThe curriculum covers a range of topics including data management, web scraping, speech-to-text, and computational text analysis. Students will hone their R and develop skills in Python, applying these languages to real-world social science problems. The course progresses from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, including the use of state-of-the-art AI models for text analysis.\n\nThe course structure consists of one lecture and one lab session per week, providing a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application. Throughout the semester, students will benefit from hands-on coding exercises, one-on-one mentoring, and collaborative projects. The course culminates in a research paper, allowing students to apply their new skills to a topic of their choice. \n\n## Course Structure\n\nThe course consists of [lectures](lectures-overview.qmd) introducing each week's content and a [course script](1_r_index.qmd) that provides hands-on coding examples for the content. It is mostly containing R with some Python mixed in for good measure when no great R alternatives exist (e.g., for web scraping with Selenium, text classification with `transformer` models). \n\nAt the beginning of the course, students are encouraged to form groups based on research interests and general vibes. I require each student group to check in with me at the beginning of each week to report their progress (even if there's nothing to report -- no progress, no problem). This does not count towards any grade but rather serves the purpose of me receiving feedback on the learning experience (this is a new course!) -- and will hopefully help me with providing more appropriate guidance.\n\nHere's an overview of the topics covered:\n\n| WEEK | TITLE | CONTENT | INFORMAL TITLE |\n|------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| 1 | Kick Off | Housekeeping; Setting up workstation; R recap | Whatever you want to know about CSS |\n| 2 | Brief Intro to Python & Regexes | Python basics (`reticulate`, data types, loops, functions, `pandas`); Regular expressions with stringr | REGEXES -- tame your data |\n| 3 | Data Acquisition I | How the web is written and ethics; `rvest` web scraping | stealing data from websites without them noticing it |\n| 4 | Data Acquisition II | Dynamic pages and forms with `selenium`; APIs with `httr2` | stealing MORE data from websites |\n| 5 | Data Acquisition III | Intro to OCR with `tesseract` and transcription (OpenAI Whisper) | making the computer your transcription servant |\n| 6 | Data Acquisition IV | Buffer sessions ; Project discussion | Questions? |\n| 7 | Student Project Week | Work on projects in class | time to get your hands dirty |\n| 8 | Text as Data I | Bag of words; Sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, NER/POS | basic text analysis |\n| 9 | Text as Data II | Supervised machine learning in theory and practice | advanced text analysis with training data |\n| 10 | Text as Data III | Unsupervised ML (topic modeling); Remote counseling pre-Christmas | finding patterns without labels |\n| 11 | Text as Data IV | Measuring similarity and distributional hypothesis; Word embeddings | cutting-edge text analysis with vector spaces |\n| 12 | Text as Data V | Supervised learning on steroids (BERT); Active learning with BERT | holy shit...transformer models |\n| 13 | Text as Data VI | LLMs for information extraction; Local LLMs primer | unleashing the power of large language models |\n| 14 | Presentation Preparation Week | Work on presentations (deadline Jan 30, 6PM) | polish your masterpiece |\n| 15 | Presentations & Wrap Up | Peer-reviewed presentations; Course wrap-up | show off your work |\n\n## Syllabus\n\nPlease click [here to download the latest version of the syllabus](./syllabus/syllabus_toolboxCSS_winter2526.pdf).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.embed-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 129%;\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.embed-container iframe,\n.embed-container object,\n.embed-container embed {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n</style>\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, read it here (probably not the best if you're visiting this page on a mobile device):\n\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"./syllabus/syllabus_toolboxCSS_winter2526.pdf\" style=\"border: 0.5px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n",
