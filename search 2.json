    "text": "Dear student,\nif you read this script, you are either participating in one of my courses on digital methods for the social sciences, or at least interested in this topic. If you have any questions or remarks regarding this script, hit me up at felix.lennert@uni-leipzig.de.\nThis script will introduce you to techniques I regard as elementary for any aspiring (computational) social scientist: the collection of digital trace data via either scraping the web or acquiring data from application programming interfaces (APIs), the analysis of text in an automated fashion (text mining), the analysis and visualization of spatial data, and the modeling of human behavior in silico (agent-based modeling).\nThe following chapters draw heavily on packages from the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) and related packages. If you have not acquired sufficient familiarity yet, you can have a look at the excellent book R for Data Science (wickham_r_2023?).\nI have added brief videos to each section. In these, I will briefly go through the code of the respective section and show a bit of what’s going on in there. I sometimes spontaneously elaborate a bit more on the examples at hand or show things in the data, so they may add some value. However, the script should be sufficient to provide you an understanding the concepts I introduce."

    "text": "Outline\nThis script will unfold as follows:\nChapter 2, “Brief R Recap,” briefly introduces RStudio Projects, Quarto, tidy data and tidyr, dplyr, ggplot, functions, loops, and purrr. These techniques are vital for the things that will come next.\nChapter 3, “R vs. Python” introduces Python and the reticulate package, which allows you to use Python in an R environment. It also introduces pandas, a powerful data manipulation package for Python.\nChapter 4, “stringr and RegExes,” deals with string manipulation using, you guessed it, stringr and RegExes.\nChapters 5 and 6, “Crawling the Web and Extracting Data” and “APIs,” introduce the reader to the basics of rvest, HTML, and CSS selectors and how these can be used to acquire data from the web. Moreover, I introduce the httr package and explain how you can use it to make requests to APIs.\nChapter 7, “selenium,” introduces selenium, a Python package that allows you to control a “headless browser” – this is invaluable if you want to scrape dynamic web sites. It will also feature an introduction to reticulate, an R package that allows you to use Python code in an R environment.\nChapter 8, “Chapter 7: OCR with tesseract,” shows you how to digitize text from pdf files or images in an automated fashion using tesseract.\nChapter 9, “OpenAI whisper” focuses on the transcription of audio files. This includes diarization.\nChapter 10, “Text Preprocessing and Featurization,” touches upon the basics of bringing text into a numeric format that lends itself to quantitative analyses. It also introduces feature weighting using TF-IDF (i.e., determining which tokens matter more than others), Named-Entity Recognition, and Part-of-Speech-tagging.\nChapter 11, “Dictionary-based analysis,” covers dictionary-based text analysis.\nChapter 12, “Supervised Classification,” deals with the classification of text in a supervised manner using tidymodels.\nChapter 13, “Unsupervised Classification,” deals with the classification of text in an unsupervised manner using “classic” Laten Dirichlet Allocation, Structural Topic Models, and Seeded Topic Models.\nChapter 14, “Word Embeddings,” showcases new text analysis techniques that are based on distributional representations of words, commonly referred to as word embeddings.\nChapter 15, “BERT” demonstrates how you can use BERT for supervised classification. This script will only contain small data-sets, since these large language models require more computing power (e.g., a server with plenty of RAM as well as sufficient CPU and/or GPU power)\nChapter 16, “Local LLMs,” introduces local large language models (LLMs) and showcases how you can use them for information extraction.\nAll chapters try to deal with social scientific examples. Data sets will be provided via Dropbox, therefore the script shall run more or less out of the box. I tried to include “Further links” for the avid readers or the ones that are dissatisfied with my coverage of the content. Exercises are included, the respective solutions will be added as the course unfolds (except for the R recap, please contact me in case you are interested)."

    "text": "This is a Quarto website for the “Forschungsseminar CSS” course at Leipzig University. It covers different techniques for the aspiring computational social scientist, hence I have dubbed it “Toolbox CSS.” You can reach me anytime at felix.lennert@uni-leipzig.de. If you’re interested in my academic work, you can visit my website.\nHere’s the official description:\nThe curriculum covers a range of topics including data management, web scraping, speech-to-text, and computational text analysis. Students will hone their R and develop skills in Python, applying these languages to real-world social science problems. The course progresses from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, including the use of state-of-the-art AI models for text analysis.\nThe course structure consists of one lecture and one lab session per week, providing a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application. Throughout the semester, students will benefit from hands-on coding exercises, one-on-one mentoring, and collaborative projects. The course culminates in a research paper, allowing students to apply their new skills to a topic of their choice."

    "text": "Course Structure\nThe course consists of lectures introducing each week’s content and a course script that provides hands-on coding examples for the content. It is mostly containing R with some Python mixed in for good measure when no great R alternatives exist (e.g., for web scraping with Selenium, text classification with transformer models).\nAt the beginning of the course, students are encouraged to form groups based on research interests and general vibes. I require each student group to check in with me at the beginning of each week to report their progress (even if there’s nothing to report – no progress, no problem). This does not count towards any grade but rather serves the purpose of me receiving feedback on the learning experience (this is a new course!) – and will hopefully help me with providing more appropriate guidance.\nHere’s an overview of the topics covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK\nTITLE\nCONTENT\nINFORMAL TITLE\n\n\n\n\n1\nKick Off\nHousekeeping; Setting up workstation; R recap\nWhatever you want to know about CSS\n\n\n2\nBrief Intro to Python & Regexes\nPython basics (reticulate, data types, loops, functions, pandas); Regular expressions with stringr\nREGEXES – tame your data\n\n\n3\nData Acquisition I\nHow the web is written and ethics; rvest web scraping\nstealing data from websites without them noticing it\n\n\n4\nData Acquisition II\nDynamic pages and forms with selenium; APIs with httr2\nstealing MORE data from websites\n\n\n5\nData Acquisition III\nIntro to OCR and transcription\nmaking images and audio readable\n\n\n6\nData Acquisition IV\nOptical Character Recognition (tesseract); Speech transcription (OpenAI Whisper); Project discussion\nmaking the computer your transcription servant\n\n\n7\nStudent Project Week\nWork on projects in class\ntime to get your hands dirty\n\n\n8\nText as Data I\nBag of words; Sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, NER/POS\nbasic text analysis\n\n\n9\nText as Data II\nSupervised machine learning in theory and practice\nadvanced text analysis with training data\n\n\n10\nText as Data III\nUnsupervised ML (topic modeling); Remote counseling pre-Christmas\nfinding patterns without labels\n\n\n11\nText as Data IV\nMeasuring similarity and distributional hypothesis; Word embeddings\ncutting-edge text analysis with vector spaces\n\n\n12\nText as Data V\nSupervised learning on steroids (BERT); Active learning with BERT\nholy shit…transformer models\n\n\n13\nText as Data VI\nLLMs for information extraction; Local LLMs primer\nunleashing the power of large language models\n\n\n14\nPresentation Preparation Week\nWork on presentations (deadline Jan 30, 6PM)\npolish your masterpiece\n\n\n15\nPresentations & Wrap Up\nPeer-reviewed presentations; Course wrap-up\nshow off your work"
